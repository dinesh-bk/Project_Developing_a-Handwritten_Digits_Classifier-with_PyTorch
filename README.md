# Project Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier-with PyTorch
As a machine learning engineer, familiarity with deep learning had been acquired, recognizing its power across various tasks, particularly in computer vision. A task had been assigned to prototype an optical character recognition (OCR) system for handwritten characters as part of a new product initiative. As the team was still in the process of collecting data samples, the individual had been tasked with presenting a proof of concept using the MNIST database of handwritten digits, considering its close resemblance in terms of input and output.

In that project, a Jupyter Notebook had been provided for all coding and written explanations. The tasks involved preprocessing a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, constructing a neural network, and subsequently training and optimizing the network using the available data.
